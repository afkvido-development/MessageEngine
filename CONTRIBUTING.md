The project is open source. Make a pull request and tell us what's going on in your pull request.
Simple.

### Don't spam, troll, add usless features, etc.
- Spamming: Just sending blank requests and changing almost nothing
- Trolling: Adding random/unwanted stuff.
- Usless features: Those are great, but you can just fork or clone the repo.
- Etc: Use commom sense.
### DO NOT ADD EZ SUGGESTIONS WITH PULL REQUESTS. Use our discord instead.
