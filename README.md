# MessageEngine


This is a singleplayer Java project that I made just becasue why not. This is the master branch, where things are hopefully stable and only fully approved commits.

If you're looking for a more fresh and updated version, check out the PTB Branch: [PTB](https://github.com/afkvido/MessageEngine/tree/PTB)
