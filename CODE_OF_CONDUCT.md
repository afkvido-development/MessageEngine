## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of

response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that they dont like, it's tyranny not democracy. Maybe they could communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate. idk.
